# Why my name is in lowercase
If you ask the government, my university, or most any electronic record of my existence, my name is "Lynne Homann Cure." However, I intentionally and invariably write my name a slightly different way: "lynne homann cure."

I do this for a couple reasons. One is a little silly (I'm an anti-capitalist) and one is simply aesthetic (it looks nicer to me when handwritten). 

Most significantly, though, is that I consider it a mild form of protest. As a transgender woman, I consider my linguistic identity -- my name, my pronouns, my manner of speech, the ways in which people refer to me -- to necessarily be defined in opposition to the "default" identity which was provided to me on birth and which cisnormative society attempts to enforce by rejecting the validity of the self-identification of trans people. I style myself in lowercase to conspicuously assert agency over the presentation of my name and, by extension, my person. 

In an era where transgender people and their right to simply be viewed authentically are under direct attack, especially in my home country of the United States, I want to make it clear that I have control not only over the sounds and symbols I use to describe myself, but also the *exact* form in which they appear. Thus, I refer to myself as lynne homann cure. If you, for whatever reason, find yourself writing about me, I request you do the same.
